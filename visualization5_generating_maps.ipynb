    "# # Folium results are interactive makes this library very useful for dashboard building.\n",

    "# Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the \n",
    "# Leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via Folium.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. \n",
    "# It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent/Vega \n",

    "# The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom \n",
